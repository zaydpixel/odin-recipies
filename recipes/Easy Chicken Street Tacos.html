    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This chicken is seasoned and ready to grill. These delicious tacos are easy to make and topped with cilantro and onions. I serve them with guacamole, salsa and fresh lime wedges on the side.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pollo para asar (seasoned, boneless, skinless chicken</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat corn tortillas until soft and pliable in the microwave, about 1 minute. Top with chicken, onions, and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
